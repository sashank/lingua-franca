BUILD
=====

Read the 'INSTALL' file for more detailed directions.

These programs use the standard ./configure ; make. You need to use
gmake, BSD make probably won't work. Remember, run ./configure --help
to see what build options are available.

In order to compile lingua-franca you need to have 
 1)GTK+ 2.0 installed (as well as the development files!).
 2)libcurl installed
 3)libxml2 installed
   The configure script will fail if you don't.
   If you don't have any of the above installed, you should install it
using your distribution's package management tools.


RUN
===

You should run 'make install' as root to make sure plugins and other files
get installed into locations they want to be in.
