This is basic design document for the Plug-in

= Introduction =

 This document contains detailed design of the plug-in
 There are four basic modules in the plug-in
        *  Chat client Specific Module
        *  Plug-in Specific Modules
             *  User Interface Module
             *  Core Translation Module
             *  XML Helper Module

== Chat Client Specific Module ==
       This module basically takes care of 
        *  Loading the plug-in and unloading the plug-in within the chat client 
        *  Carrying out the actual translation

     Detailed Steps are as follows 

        #  Initialize the plug-in 
        #  Load the plug-in into chat client
        #  User to configure the preferences
        #  Wait for the signal "message-typed" 
             *  Call translate_outgoing_message method  when event occurs
             *  On successful translation emit the signal "message_translated"
        #  Wait for the signal "message-received" 
             *  Call translate_incoming_message method when event occurs
             *  On successful translation emit the signal "message_translated"
        #  Unload the plug-in gracefully when the chat client process is shutdown

     _*Note*_  The above design is highly specific to pidgin , more generic design will be made once we are ready to develop for other chat clients 


== Plug-in Specific Modules ==
         Plug-in has three modules 
              *  User Interface Module
                    *  Initialize the Preferences window.
