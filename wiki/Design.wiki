This is basic design document for the Plug-in

= Introduction =

 This document contains detailed design of the plug-in
 There are four basic modules in the plug-in
        *  Chat client Specific Module
        *  Plug-in Specific Modules
             *  User Interface Module
             *  Core Translation Module
             *  XML Helper Module

= Chat Client Specific Module ==
       This module basically takes care of 
        *  Loading the plug-in and unloading the plug-in within the chat client 
        *  Carrying out the actual translation

     Detailed Steps are as follows 

        #  Initialize the plug-in 
        #  Load the plug-in into chat client
        #  User to configure the preferences
        #  Wait for the signal "message-typed" 
             *  Call translate_outgoing_message method  when event occurs
             *  On successful translation emit the signal "message_translated"
        #  Wait for the signal "message-received" 
             *  Call translate_incoming_message method when event occurs
             *  On successful translation emit the signal "message_translated"
        #  Unload the plug-in gracefully when the chat client process is shutdown

     *Note* The above design is highly specific to pidgin , more generic design will be made once we are ready to develop for other chat clients 


= Plug-in Specific Modules =
         Plug-in has three modules 
              *  User Interface Module
                    *  Initialize the Preferences window.
                    *  Save the preferences into XML File.
              *  Core Translation Module
                    *  Translate Outgoing Messages
                    *  Translate Incoming Messages
              *  XML Helper Module
                    *  Provides 
== User Interface ==

    For the Initialization of the User Interface the below are required
           *  List of buddies available 
               This can be got from the layer above , i.e from Chat Client API.
           *  List of available Languages
               This can be got from the XML Helper
           *  List of available Translation Services
               This can be got from the XML Helper
           *  XML File Location.
               The directory path t preferences XML 
    The preferences window for configuring user preferences is basically a tabbed window classified as follows 
     # General Tab
         *  Incoming Language Preference
             *  An Incoming Lang Preference Label 
             *  A Combo Box containing list of available languages
         *  Outgoing Language Preference
             *  An Outgoing Lang Preference Label
             *  A Combo Box containing list of available languages
     # Buddy Config Tab
