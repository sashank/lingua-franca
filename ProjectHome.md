Below are the basic features
  1. User can translate all the incoming chat text to language of his preference
  1. User can translate all outgoing chat messages to language of his choice
  1. User can translate outgoing chat text to a particular buddy from his list
  1. Any combination of 1,2,3 is possible
> (for ex he may have set 1 on 2 off and 3 on , etc)
Note: language translation may have issues when words of one language are intersperse in another language
> > So no guarantees that (1) , (2), (3) will be obeyed even if user mixes things.
Best effort translation only.
